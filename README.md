## Request Log (Latest First)

### Date: 2024-08-19

**Features & Changes:**

1.  **`Healer` Overlay Logic Clarification:**
    *   The `Healer` overlay's behavior has been updated. It now adds a flat 10 HP to surrounding bricks each turn, allowing their health to go above their original maximum ("overheal").
    *   The previous "heal-to-max" logic has been removed to allow for this continuous health buffing every turn.
    *   Internal calculations for coin/gem drops were adjusted to correctly handle overhealed bricks.

### Date: 2024-08-18

**Features & Changes:**

1.  **`Healer` Overlay Bug Fix:**
    *   Corrected the behavior of the `Healer` overlay. It now properly restores 10 HP to surrounding bricks, up to their current maximum health.
    *   Previously, it was incorrectly increasing their maximum health by 10 HP each turn, leading to unintended difficulty scaling.

### Date: 2024-08-17

**Features & Changes:**

1.  **`WoolBrick` Generation Rework:**
    *   **Placement:** `WoolBrick`s now spawn in single lines or waves instead of random clusters, making them less overwhelming and more predictable.
    *   **Spawning:** The chance for additional `WoolBrick`s to spawn when a `Builder` or `Healer` overlay is created has been reduced to 10%.
    *   **Health Buff:** Any leftover HP from the level's HP pool at the end of the generation process is now used to buff the health of existing `WoolBrick`s, making them tougher strategic targets.

### Date: 2024-08-16

**Features & Changes:**

1.  **New Late-Game Bricks (Unlocked at Level 20):**
    *   **`WoolBrick`**: A new light-pink brick that is completely immune to indirect damage sources like explosions, line clears, projectiles, and auras. It can only be damaged by a direct hit from the player's main ball or mini-balls. This brick is designed to counter "one-shot" area-of-effect strategies.
    *   **`ShieldGenBrick`**: A new cyan, rounded brick that projects a 50% damage reduction aura to all bricks within a 2-tile radius, making it a high-priority target. The ShieldGenBrick itself is not affected by its own aura.

2.  **Updated Level Generation:**
    *   The level generation logic has been updated to incorporate these new bricks.
    *   `WoolBrick`s spawn in connected clusters based on a level-scaling chance. More can be added when `Builder` or `Healer` overlays are created.
    *   `ShieldGenBrick`s have a small chance to be placed on a brick that was about to be buffed, creating strategic choke points.

### Date: 2024-08-15

**Features & Changes:**

1.  **Aiming Preview Rework:**
    *   The aiming preview has been reworked for consistency. "Ghost balls" now spawn automatically every 10 frames while the player is aiming, independent of mouse movement.
    *   The duration that these ghost balls last is now correctly determined by the "Aiming Length" shop upgrade (starting at 0.4 seconds).

### Date: 2024-08-15

**Features & Changes:**

1.  **Level Generation Logic Fix:**
    *   Corrected the order of operations in level generation to ensure coins are distributed *after* the brick merging step. This fixes a bug where newly merged bricks would not contain any coins.
    *   The coin distribution logic now correctly identifies all eligible normal bricks (including merged ones) to receive coins from the level's pool.

2.  **Documentation:**
    *   Added detailed comments to the `levelgen.js` file, outlining each step of the procedural generation process.
    *   Added a new "Level Generation Logic" section to this `README.md` to provide a clear, high-level overview of how levels are built.

### Date: 2024-08-14

**Features & Changes:**

1.  **XP Progression Fix:**
    *   Corrected the formula for the experience required to level up. It now follows the intended scaling curve (50 for Lv2, 150 for Lv3, 300 for Lv4, etc.), ensuring a more balanced progression.

2.  **Documentation & UI:**
    *   Performed a full audit of the project and updated the `README.md` to accurately reflect all current game mechanics, including the `BulletBall`, `HomingBall`, and the full unlock progression up to level 18.
    *   The "Cheat XP" button in the Level Settings modal now correctly displays "+5000 XP".

### Date: 2024-08-13

**Features & Changes:**

1.  **Brick Visual Overhaul:**
    *   The visuals for `normal` bricks have been completely redesigned to clearly communicate health.
    *   **Color Tiers:** Bricks now cycle through four distinct color tiers based on major 50 HP thresholds.
    *   **Pyramid Layers:** Within each color tier, bricks gain a new visible layer on top for every 10 HP, stacking up to a maximum of 5 layers. This creates an intuitive "pyramid" effect that shows health at a glance.

2.  **Quality of Life & UI:**
    *   **Auto-Buy Ball:** If the player runs out of balls but has enough coins to purchase a new one, the game will now automatically buy a ball for them to prevent an unnecessary game over.
    *   **Result Overlay Fix:** Fixed a rendering order bug that was causing the "Game Over" and "Level Complete" screens to be hidden behind other game elements.
    *   **XP Sound Reset:** The sound effect for collecting XP orbs now resets its pitch if no orbs have been collected in the last 40 frames, improving audio feedback.
    *   **Cheat XP Button:** This button in the Level Settings now adds XP directly for faster testing.

### Date: 2024-08-12

**Features & Changes:**

1.  **Gameplay & Balancing:**
    *   **Comprehensive Speed-Up:** The "Speed Up" button now affects the entire game simulation, running it at 3x speed. This includes physics, animations, cooldowns, VFX lifespans, and magnetic attraction forces.
    *   **Shop Unlocks:** Shop upgrades for specific ball types (e.g., Explosive Damage) are now hidden until the corresponding ball is unlocked.
    *   **New Upgrade: Bonus XP:** A new shop upgrade that increases XP gain is now available, unlocking at Level 13.
    *   **Level 5 Unlock:** The unlock at level 5 has been changed from "+1 Starting Ball" to increasing the number of "+1 Ball Bricks" that appear in levels.
    *   **Rebalancing:** Adjusted the cost for purchasing extra balls and the stats for the Brick Ball coin upgrade.

2.  **VFX & SFX:**
    *   **XP Collection SFX:** The sound for collecting XP orbs now increases in pitch with each subsequent orb collected in a chain.
    *   **Mini-Ball Magnetism:** The small balls from `SplitBall` now have their own magnetic radius to help collect XP orbs.

3.  **UI & Quality of Life:**
    *   **XP Bar Animation:** The white "pending XP" preview bar now remains static while the main blue bar animates to fill up to it, providing clearer feedback.
    *   **Shop Text:** Updated "Permanent Upgrades" to the more accurate "Upgrades for this run".

### Date: 2024-08-09

**Features & Changes:**

1.  **New Progression System & Feature Unlocks:**
    *   **Persistent XP:** Player's main level and XP are no longer reset on Game Over, creating a continuous progression path.
    *   **Feature Gating:** Major game systems (new balls, shop, combos, etc.) are now unlocked gradually as the player levels up.
    *   **Level Up Modal:** The level-up visual effect has been replaced with a popup panel that clearly announces the newly unlocked feature.

2.  **New Ball Type: `ClassicBall`:**
    *   Added the `ClassicBall`, a new starting ball with no special abilities but 150% of the standard ball's HP, providing a durable option for new players.

3.  **UI & Quality of Life:**
    *   **Player Level Badge:** The player's XP level is now shown in a compact, gem-like "XP Ore" badge in the top-left corner.
    *   The `startingBalls` for a run is now determined by the player's main level unlocks (3, or 4).

### Date: 2024-08-08

**Features & Changes:**

1.  **New Progression System:**
    *   **XP and Leveling:** The score system has been completely replaced with a player leveling system based on Experience Points (XP).
    *   **XP Bar:** A new, persistent XP bar is displayed at the top of the screen.
    *   **Leveling Curve:** The XP required to level up increases with each level.

2.  **New Loot System: XP Orbs:**
    *   **Brick Drops:** Destroying a brick now drops XP Orbs. The number of orbs is based on the brick's initial maximum health (1 orb per 10 HP).
    *   **Orb Collection:** Orbs become collectible after a 1-second delay. The player's ball has a magnetic field that automatically collects nearby orbs.
    *   **UI Feedback:** Collected XP is added to a "pending" pool for the current turn, which is visualized on the XP bar. At the end of the turn, the pending XP is officially added to the player's total.

3.  **VFX & SFX:**
    *   Added new visuals for XP Orbs (idle, attraction, collection).
    *   Added new sound effects for collecting an orb and for leveling up.
    *   Added a major visual effect for the "LEVEL UP!" moment.

4.  **UI & Quality of Life:**
    *   **Player Level Badge:** The player's XP level is now shown in a compact, gem-like "XP Ore" badge in the top-left corner.
    *   **Game Level Display:** The current game level (difficulty) is now also displayed in the top-left, separate from the player's XP level.
    *   The "Score" display has been removed from the UI.
    *   A "Cheat XP" button was added to the shop for easier testing of the new progression system.

### Date: 2024-08-07

**Features & Changes:**

1.  **Gameplay & Balancing:**
    *   **PiercingBall Rebalance:** This ball has been significantly changed to create a high-risk, high-reward playstyle.
        *   **During Power-up:** The ball is now completely intangible. It phases through bricks without dealing damage and without incrementing the combo, acting as a purely strategic move.
        *   **Normal State:** When *not* using its power-up, the ball now takes 2 damage for every brick it hits. This makes it a fragile ball that requires careful aim to preserve.
    *   **BrickBall Enhancement:** The `BrickBall`'s power-up ability can now destroy and replace `normal` bricks even if they have a `Builder`, `Healer`, or `Mine` overlay, increasing its utility.

2.  **Visual Fixes:**
    *   **ExplosiveBall Visuals:** The special visuals for the `ExplosiveBall` (its pulsating red glow and orange outline) now correctly disappear once all of its power-up uses have been consumed, making it consistent with other ball types.

### Date: 2024-08-06

**Features & Changes:**

1.  **Gameplay & Balancing:**
    *   **Ball Size:** The four standard ball types (`explosive`, `piercing`, `split`, `brick`) have been made 20% smaller for better maneuverability.
    *   **SplitBall Combo:** The small balls generated by the `SplitBall`'s power-up now correctly contribute to the main combo counter.
    *   **Smarter Game Over:** The game over condition is now more forgiving. The game will only end if the player is out of regular balls, has no `GiantBall`s left, AND cannot afford to purchase a new ball from the shop.

2.  **Game Logic & VFX:**
    *   **Builder/Healer Stacking:** The effects of `Builder` and `Healer` bricks now stack. A brick buffed by multiple Builders will receive a multiplied health bonus. A new brick spawned on a tile targeted by multiple builders will be created with multiplied health. Healers also stack their healing effect on a single target.
    *   **BrickBall Power-up Fix:** The `BrickBall`'s power-up ability now correctly destroys any bricks it replaces, ensuring their on-death effects (explosions, coin drops, etc.) are triggered before the new bricks are spawned.
    *   **StripeBrick Visuals:** The arrows on `StripeBrick`s have been inverted to point outwards, more clearly indicating the direction of the blast.

### Date: 2024-08-05

**Features & Changes:**

1.  **VFX & Visuals Overhaul:**
    *   **Explosion VFX:** The explosion effect (from `ExplosiveBall` and `ExplosiveBrick`) has been reworked. It now starts at full size, with its border growing thicker as it fades out for a more impactful feel.
    *   **Stripe Brick VFX:** The line-clearing effect for `StripeBrick` no longer uses a generic white flash. It now shoots a burst of fast-moving particles in the direction of the line clear.
    *   **ExplosiveBall Visuals:** The `ExplosiveBall` is now a vibrant yellow ball with a pulsating red outer glow.
    *   **StripeBrick Visuals:** `StripeBrick`s are now red with white, elevator-style arrows indicating their clear direction, improving readability.

2.  **UI Improvements:**
    *   The "Giant: X" stat has been removed from the top-left UI for a cleaner look.
    *   The `GiantBall` button in the ball selector UI is now completely hidden if the player has zero giant balls.
    *   When giant balls are awarded from a high combo, a "+N Giant Ball" text now appears below the main combo announcement to provide clear feedback.

3.  **Game Logic Tuning:**
    *   **Level Generation:** Bricks designated to be `Builder` or `Healer` hosts are now also eligible to receive extra HP from the level's HP Pool, making them more resilient.

4.  **Documentation:**
    *   Added a new "Internal Naming Conventions" section to this README to standardize terms for game elements.

### Date: 2024-08-02

**Features & Changes:**

1.  **New Combo & Bonus System:**
    *   **Combo Counter:** A combo counter increases with every brick hit by the main ball or destroyed by any means. It resets to 0 if the main ball hits a wall.
    *   **End-of-Turn Bonuses:** The highest combo achieved in a turn determines the rewards spawned for the next turn.
    *   **VFX:** Added combo counter VFX and a special announcement effect for the max combo achieved.

2.  **Combo Rewards (Tiered System):**
    *   **Mine Overlay (Combo 1-15):** For every 3 combo points, a "Mine" overlay is placed on a random existing brick. When the host brick is hit, it creates a 10-damage explosion to its 8 neighbors.
    *   **Stripe Bricks (Combo 1-60):** For every 15 combo points, a new `StripeBrick` (Horizontal or Vertical, 10 HP) is spawned in an empty space. When destroyed, it deals 30 damage to its entire row or column.
    *   **Giant Ball (Combo 50+):** For every 50 combo points (no limit), the player is awarded one consumable `GiantBall`.

3.  **New Ball Type: Giant Ball (Consumable):**
    *   A new UI element tracks the number of Giant Balls available.
    *   Using a Giant Ball does not consume a regular ball from the player's stock.
    *   **Behavior:** It's a larger, slower ball that moves through bricks (does not bounce), dealing 1000 damage to each brick it touches. It has a fixed 10 HP and is destroyed upon hitting the first wall.
    *   **Limitation:** Turns where a Giant Ball is used do not generate combos or combo bonuses.

4.  **Balancing and UI:**
    *   Builder overlay spawn cost increased to 100 HP Pool.
    *   Healer overlay spawn cost increased to 80 HP Pool.
    *   Default spawn chance for both changed to 3%.
    *   Their inputs in the Level Settings are now number fields instead of sliders for easier input.

### Date: 2024-08-01

**Features & Changes:**

1.  **New Brick Overlay: Builder**
    *   **Visual:** A `(+)` shaped aura on top of a normal brick. Dies if the host brick is destroyed.
    *   **Behavior:** At the end of each turn, the Builder spawns four 10-HP bricks in the nearest available adjacent spots. If a direction is blocked, it will build past the obstruction. If a direction is fully blocked to the edge, it will grant +10 HP to the last brick in that line instead.
    *   **VFX:** Added a visual effect for the building action.

2.  **New Brick Overlay: Healer**
    *   **Visual:** A circular aura on top of a normal brick. Dies with the host.
    *   **Behavior:** At the end of each turn, the Healer restores 10 HP to all 8 surrounding non-special bricks.
    *   **VFX:** Added a visual effect for the healing action.

3.  **Updated Level Generation for Overlays:**
    *   Added `BuilderBrickChance` and `HealerBrickChance` (default 5% each) to the Level Generation Settings.
    *   During the HP distribution phase of level generation, a normal brick has a chance to become a Builder or Healer host instead of gaining HP. This conversion costs 50 HP from the level's HP Pool.

4.  **Responsive In-Game UI Redesign:**
    *   The Ball Health Bar and Power-Up counter are now drawn where the Ball Selector UI appears (bottom-center for portrait, mid-left for landscape).
    *   The number of health segments per row is no longer fixed at 10 but adapts dynamically to the available screen width.

### Date: 2024-07-31

**Features & Changes:**

1.  **Project `README.md`:**
    *   This file was created to log the context of development requests moving forward.

2.  **Level Generation Overhaul:**
    *   **Creative Formulas:** Added new procedural generation algorithms to the "Formulaic" pattern pool to create more varied and interesting brick layouts, including:
        *   Circles
        *   Triangles (isosceles)
        *   Rotated Rectangles
        *   Polygons/Stars
    *   **Strict Brick & HP Distribution Logic:**
        *   The generation process now strictly adheres to the specified brick count and HP pool.
        *   Goal Bricks and +1 Ball Bricks are placed first and do not count towards the level's `brickCount`.
        *   The engine places 10-HP bricks until the `brickCount` is met, generating new formulaic shapes if the previous one runs out of space.
        *   After the target brick count is reached, any remaining HP from the `HPPool` is distributed among the placed normal bricks, increasing their health.
    *   **Updated Default Balancing:**
        *   Starting Bricks: `20`
        *   Bricks per Level: `10`
        *   Max Bricks: `300`
        *   Starting HP Pool: `100`
        *   HP Pool per Level: `80`
        *   HP Multiplier/Lvl: `1.05`
    *   **New "Few Brick Layout" Feature:**
        *   Added a "FewBrickLayoutChance" parameter to Level Settings (default 10%).
        *   When triggered, the level generates with only 20% of the normal brick count, but with the full HP pool distributed among them, creating rare and difficult levels with very tough bricks.

3.  **UI Redesign: In-Canvas Health Bar & Power-Up Counter:**
    *   The HTML-based health bar and power-up indicator have been removed.
    *   These UI elements are now drawn directly onto the p5.js canvas.
    *   They are located in the bottom-left of the game area.
    *   The health bar's segments now visually represent partial health (e.g., a half-filled segment for 5 HP).
    *   The bar supports high HP values by wrapping into multiple rows, with a maximum of 10 segments per row, stacking from the bottom-up.

## Level Generation Logic

The game's levels are procedurally generated to provide a unique challenge each time. The generation follows a specific, multi-step process to ensure balance and variety:

1.  **Initialization & Seeding**: The process begins by creating an empty grid and using a "seed" (either user-provided or random) to ensure the level can be re-created exactly.

2.  **Calculate Level Parameters**: Based on the player's current level number and the settings, the engine calculates key stats for the new level:
    *   **Total Brick HP Pool**: The total health that will be distributed among all bricks. This scales up with each level.
    *   **Total Coin Pool**: The total number of coins that will be embedded in bricks. Bonus levels receive a significant multiplier.
    *   **Target Brick Count**: The number of normal bricks to place. This also scales with the level but has a chance to generate a rare "few brick layout" where the count is low but the HP per brick is very high.

3.  **Place Special Bricks**: Critical bricks are placed first in random empty spots:
    *   **Goal Bricks**: The yellow bricks that must be destroyed to win.
    *   **+1 Ball Bricks**: Green bricks that grant an extra ball.

4.  **Generate Brick Layout**: The engine places normal bricks until the `Target Brick Count` is met, using one of several patterns:
    *   **Formulaic (Default)**: Uses mathematical formulas to create interesting shapes like circles, waves, triangles, and stars.
    *   **Other Patterns**: Includes options for solid blocks, checkerboards, or spirals.

5.  **Distribute HP & Create Overlays**: The `Total Brick HP Pool` is now distributed among the newly placed normal bricks, increasing their health from the base 10 HP. During this process:
    *   Normal bricks have a chance to be converted into hosts for special **Builder** or **Healer** overlays, which costs a chunk of the HP pool.

6.  **Merge Bricks**: The engine scans the grid for three adjacent normal bricks that have reached their maximum health (200 HP). If found, and if there's enough HP remaining in the pool, these three bricks are merged into a single, massive 3x1 or 1x3 brick with 600 HP.

7.  **Distribute Coins**: After all bricks are placed, buffed, and potentially merged, the `Total Coin Pool` is distributed among the remaining `normal` bricks (including merged ones). A brick's health determines how many coins it can hold.

8.  **Final Touches**:
    *   **Ball Cages**: High-HP bricks have a final chance to spawn a special "Ball Cage" brick in a nearby empty tile.
    *   The engine generates the small yellow coin indicators on bricks that have coins and does one last check to ensure at least one Goal brick exists before finishing.
